        <h1 id ="motivation">The Shell</h1>
        <p>
            Before diving into shell you should know some terminologies listed below:
        </p>
        <p>
            <u><strong>command-line interface (CLI):</strong></u>
            A command-line interface (CLI) is a way to interact with your computer by typing text commands instead of clicking on icons or using a mouse. 🖥️📝 It's like having a conversation with your computer using written language. With a CLI, you can perform tasks such as opening files, running programs, managing files and folders, and much more, all by typing specific commands into a special window called a terminal. 💻 CLI gives you direct control over your computer's functions and can be very powerful once you learn the commands. It's commonly used by programmers, system administrators, and power users who need precise control over their computers. 🚀
            <p>it's looks like 👇</p>
            <img src="/content/day_3/images/cli.png" alt="cli">
        </p>
        <p>
            <u><strong>graphical user interface (GUI) </strong></u>
            A graphical user interface (GUI) is a visual way to interact with your computer using images, icons, and menus instead of just text. 🖥️🖱️ It's like having a virtual desktop where you can see and click on different elements to perform tasks. With a GUI, you can easily navigate through your computer's files and folders, open programs by clicking on their icons, resize windows, and much more. GUIs make it easier for people to use computers because they don't need to remember complex commands or typing. Instead, they can simply point and click on the items they want to interact with. GUIs are commonly used in operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux, as well as in many software applications. 🌟
            <p>This show CLI v/s GUI👇</p>

        </p>
        <p>
            <u><strong>Terminal:</strong></u>
            A terminal is like a special window on your computer where you can type commands to control it directly. 💻 It's a text-based interface that allows you to interact with your computer using written language instead of clicking on icons or buttons. Terminals are commonly used by programmers, system administrators, and advanced users who need precise control over their computers. Inside a terminal, you can run programs, navigate through files and folders, manage system settings, and perform many other tasks by typing specific commands. 📝 Terminals are often associated with command-line interfaces (CLIs), where you enter commands to execute tasks, but they can also be used for other purposes, such as debugging and system administration. Overall, terminals provide a powerful and flexible way to control your computer's functions directly through text commands. 🚀

        <p><strong>Now let's dive into Shell:</strong></p>
        <p>
            The shell is like the backstage area of your computer where you can give it commands directly using text. 💻 It's a way to interact with your computer by typing commands and getting responses back. Unlike fancy graphical interfaces or voice commands, the shell allows you to do things in a more flexible and powerful way. It's like having a secret language to talk to your computer and tell it exactly what you want it to do. One common type of shell is called "bash," which stands for Bourne Again SHell. It's widely used and works similarly to other shells. To use the shell, you need a terminal, which is like a window where you can type commands. Your computer probably already has a terminal, but if not, you can easily install one. 📟🔧</p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2 id="using">Using the Shell</h2>
        <p>
            When you launch your terminal, you will see a prompt that often looks a little like this:
        </p>
        <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">missing:~$</span><span class="w"> 
        </span></code></pre></div>
        <p>
            Think of this as your computer's text message board. It shows you the name of your computer and where you're currently hanging out in its files. The "~" symbol means you're in your home base, like your computer's cozy den. The "$" symbol tells you that you're just a regular user, not the big boss. Here, you can type commands, and your computer will do what you ask. The easiest thing you can do is to tell your computer to run a program or do something specific. 
        </p>
        <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">missing:~$</span><span class="nb">date</span>
            <span class="go">Wed 20 Mar 2024 11:49:31 AM IST
            </span><span class="gp">missing:~$</span><span class="w"> 
            </span></code></pre></div>
    </p>
    <p>
        Here, we ran a program called "date," which simply displays the current date and time. 🕒 After running the command, the shell is ready for more instructions from us. We can also include additional information, called arguments, when we run a command. For example, we could tell the "date" program to display the date in a specific format or time zone by adding arguments. 📅🔄
        <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">missing:~$</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">echo </span>hello
            <span class="go">hello
            </span></code></pre></div>
    </p>
    <p>

Here, we instructed the shell to run the "echo" program with the argument "hello." The "echo" program does exactly what its name suggests: it echoes or prints out whatever text it receives as an argument. 🗣️ The shell understands our command by breaking it into parts separated by spaces, and then it executes the program indicated by the first part (in this case, "echo"), passing the subsequent parts as arguments to the program. If you need to include an argument that contains spaces or special characters (like a directory named "My Photos"), you can enclose the argument in single quotes ('My Photos') or double quotes ("My Photos"), or you can escape the relevant characters using backslashes (My\ Photos). This ensures that the shell interprets the argument correctly. 📝🔍
    </p>
    <p>
        The shell knows how to find programs like "date" or "echo" because it's like a programming environment, similar to Python or Ruby. 🐍🔮 Just like in those languages, the shell has variables, conditionals, loops, and functions (which we'll cover in the next lecture!). When you type commands in your shell, you're essentially writing a small piece of code for the shell to interpret. If you enter a command that doesn't match one of the shell's built-in functions, it checks a special environment variable called $PATH. This variable tells the shell which directories to search for programs when you give it a command. So, if you type "date" or "echo," the shell looks in the directories listed in $PATH to find and execute those programs. 🚀💻
    
        <div class="terminal">
            <div class="line"><span class="prompt">missing:~$</span><span class="command"> echo $PATH</span></div>
            <div class="line output">/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin</div>
            <div class="line"><span class="prompt">missing:~$</span><span class="command"> which echo</span></div>
            <div class="line output">/bin/echo</div>
            <div class="line"><span class="prompt">missing:~$</span><span class="command"> /bin/echo $PATH</span></div>
            <div class="line output">/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin</div>
        </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            When we type the "echo" command, the shell understands that it needs to execute the "echo" program. To do this, the shell searches through a list of directories specified in the $PATH variable, separating them with colons. 🔄 It looks for a file named "echo" in each of these directories. Once it finds the "echo" program, it runs it, but only if the file is marked as executable (we'll discuss this in more detail later). If you want to know which file is being executed for a particular program, you can use the "which" command. Additionally, if you prefer to directly specify the path to the file you want to execute, you can bypass the $PATH variable altogether. This gives you more control over which version of a program you're running. 🛣️🔍
        </p>
        <h2 id="using">Navigating in the shell</h2>
        <p>

In the shell, a path is a series of directories separated by slashes (/) on Linux and macOS, and backslashes () on Windows. On Linux and macOS, the root directory, denoted by /, is the starting point for the entire file system, containing all directories and files. Conversely, Windows has a separate root directory for each disk partition (e.g., C:). For the purposes of this class, we'll assume you're using a Linux file system. An absolute path starts with / and specifies the exact location of a file or directory in the file system. Any path that doesn't start with / is called a relative path. Relative paths are based on the current working directory, which you can see with the "pwd" command and change with the "cd" command. Within a path, a single dot (.) refers to the current directory, and two dots (..) refer to the parent directory. These concepts help you navigate the file system efficiently. 📂🔍
<div class="terminal">
    <div class="line"><span class="prompt">missing:~$</span><span class="command"> pwd</span></div>
    <div class="line output">/home/missing</div>
    <div class="line"><span class="prompt">missing:~$</span><span class="command"> cd /home</span></div>

    <div class="line"><span class="prompt">missing:/home$</span><span class="command"> cd missing</span></div>
    <div class="line"><span class="prompt">missing:~$</span><span class="command"> pwd</span></div>

    <div class="line"><span class="prompt">missing:~$</span><span class="command"> ../../bin/echo hello</span></div>
    <div class="line output">hello</div>
</div>

Throughout our shell interactions, the prompt consistently showed us our current working directory. This is helpful for keeping track of where we are in the file system. 📁💡 You can customize your prompt to display various useful information, such as the current user, hostname, or even git branch information. We'll explore how to configure and personalize your prompt in a future lecture. 🛠️👨‍💻

    Typically, when we execute a program, it operates within the current directory unless instructed otherwise. 📂 For instance, it will often search for files in that directory and create new files there if necessary. To view the contents of a specific directory, we use the "ls" command. 📜🔍
    <div class="terminal">
    <div class="line"><span class="prompt">missing:~$</span><span class="command"> ls</span></div>
    <div class="line output">bin boot dev etc home</div>
    <div class="line"><span class="prompt">missing:~$</span><span class="command"> cd ..</span></div>
    <div class="line output"> </div>
    <div class="line"><span class="prompt">missing:/home$</span><span class="command"> ls</span></div>
    <div class="line output">missing</div>
    <div class="line"><span class="prompt">missing:/home$</span><span class="command"> cd ..</span></div>
    <div class="line output"> </div>
    <div class="line"><span class="prompt">missing:/$</span><span class="command"> ls</span></div>
    <div class="line output">bin boot dev etc home</div>
</div>
<p>
    Normally, when you use the 📁 ls command, it shows the files and folders in the current directory. But you can add extra instructions, called flags or options, to change how it works. These flags usually start with a hyphen (-). For example, if you run 📁 ls --help, it will give you a helpful message explaining what flags you can use and what they do. This helps you understand how to use the command better.
    <div class="terminal">
        <div class="line"><span class="prompt">missing:~$</span><span class="command"> ls -l /home</span></div>
        <div class="line output">
            drwxr-xr-x 1 missing users 4096 Apr 7 2024 missing html code
        </div>
    </div>

    This gives us detailed information about each file or directory. The 'd' at the beginning indicates that 'missing' is a directory. Then, there are three groups of three characters (rwx), representing permissions for the owner, the owning group, and everyone else. 'r' stands for read, 'w' for write, and 'x' for execute. For directories, 'x' permission allows access to enter the directory and list its contents. For files, 'x' permission allows execution. Most files in /bin have 'x' permission for everyone, allowing anyone to execute those programs.
</p>
<p>
    Some other handy programs to know about at this point are mv (to rename/move a file), cp (to copy a file), and mkdir (to make a new directory).
</p>
<p>

If you ever need more details about a program's usage, arguments, or functionality, you can use the man command. Simply type man followed by the name of the program, and it will display the manual page with comprehensive information. You can navigate through the manual page using arrow keys, and press 'q' to exit when you're done reading. This is a handy way to quickly learn about different commands and their options.
<div class="terminal">
