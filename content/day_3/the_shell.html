        <h1 id ="motivation">The Shell</h1>
        <p>
            Before diving into shell you should know some terminologies listed below:
        </p>
        <p>
            <u><strong>command-line interface (CLI):</strong></u>
            A command-line interface (CLI) is a way to interact with your computer by typing text commands instead of clicking on icons or using a mouse. 🖥️📝 It's like having a conversation with your computer using written language. With a CLI, you can perform tasks such as opening files, running programs, managing files and folders, and much more, all by typing specific commands into a special window called a terminal. 💻 CLI gives you direct control over your computer's functions and can be very powerful once you learn the commands. It's commonly used by programmers, system administrators, and power users who need precise control over their computers. 🚀
            <p>it's looks like 👇</p>

        </p>
        <p>
            <u><strong>graphical user interface (GUI) </strong></u>
            A graphical user interface (GUI) is a visual way to interact with your computer using images, icons, and menus instead of just text. 🖥️🖱️ It's like having a virtual desktop where you can see and click on different elements to perform tasks. With a GUI, you can easily navigate through your computer's files and folders, open programs by clicking on their icons, resize windows, and much more. GUIs make it easier for people to use computers because they don't need to remember complex commands or typing. Instead, they can simply point and click on the items they want to interact with. GUIs are commonly used in operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux, as well as in many software applications. 🌟

        <p>
            <u><strong>Terminal:</strong></u>
            A terminal is like a special window on your computer where you can type commands to control it directly. 💻 It's a text-based interface that allows you to interact with your computer using written language instead of clicking on icons or buttons. Terminals are commonly used by programmers, system administrators, and advanced users who need precise control over their computers. Inside a terminal, you can run programs, navigate through files and folders, manage system settings, and perform many other tasks by typing specific commands. 📝 Terminals are often associated with command-line interfaces (CLIs), where you enter commands to execute tasks, but they can also be used for other purposes, such as debugging and system administration. Overall, terminals provide a powerful and flexible way to control your computer's functions directly through text commands. 🚀

        <p><strong>Now let's dive into Shell:</strong></p>
        <p>
            The shell is like the backstage area of your computer where you can give it commands directly using text. 💻 It's a way to interact with your computer by typing commands and getting responses back. Unlike fancy graphical interfaces or voice commands, the shell allows you to do things in a more flexible and powerful way. It's like having a secret language to talk to your computer and tell it exactly what you want it to do. One common type of shell is called "bash," which stands for Bourne Again SHell. It's widely used and works similarly to other shells. To use the shell, you need a terminal, which is like a window where you can type commands. Your computer probably already has a terminal, but if not, you can easily install one. 📟🔧</p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2 id="using">Using the Shell</h2>
        <p>
            When you launch your terminal, you will see a prompt that often looks a little like this:
        </p>
        <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">missing:~$</span><span class="w"> 
        </span></code></pre></div>
        <p>
            Think of this as your computer's text message board. It shows you the name of your computer and where you're currently hanging out in its files. The "~" symbol means you're in your home base, like your computer's cozy den. The "$" symbol tells you that you're just a regular user, not the big boss. Here, you can type commands, and your computer will do what you ask. The easiest thing you can do is to tell your computer to run a program or do something specific. 
        </p>
        <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">missing:~$</span><span class="nb">date</span>
            <span class="go">Wed 20 Mar 2024 11:49:31 AM IST
            </span><span class="gp">missing:~$</span><span class="w"> 
            </span></code></pre></div>
    </p>
    <p>
        Here, we ran a program called "date," which simply displays the current date and time. 🕒 After running the command, the shell is ready for more instructions from us. We can also include additional information, called arguments, when we run a command. For example, we could tell the "date" program to display the date in a specific format or time zone by adding arguments. 📅🔄
        <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">missing:~$</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">echo </span>hello
            <span class="go">hello
            </span></code></pre></div>
    </p>
    <p>

Here, we instructed the shell to run the "echo" program with the argument "hello." The "echo" program does exactly what its name suggests: it echoes or prints out whatever text it receives as an argument. 🗣️ The shell understands our command by breaking it into parts separated by spaces, and then it executes the program indicated by the first part (in this case, "echo"), passing the subsequent parts as arguments to the program. If you need to include an argument that contains spaces or special characters (like a directory named "My Photos"), you can enclose the argument in single quotes ('My Photos') or double quotes ("My Photos"), or you can escape the relevant characters using backslashes (My\ Photos). This ensures that the shell interprets the argument correctly. 📝🔍
