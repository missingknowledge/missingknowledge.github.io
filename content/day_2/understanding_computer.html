<!-- ------------------SECTION ONE (HOW THE MEMORY WORKS)----------------------------- -->

    <p>
      <h1 id="motivation">Understanding how memory works.</h1>
      <p>Computer memory is like a digital storage unit where information is stored and retrieved using binary data, represented by 0s and 1s. 🧠 One way to physically store this binary data is by using capacitors.</p>

<p><strong>1. Understanding Capacitors:</strong><br>
Think of capacitors as tiny electronic containers that store electrical energy. They have two plates separated by an insulating material. When electricity flows through, one plate gets charged up, storing energy, and when the power stops, the capacitor releases the stored energy. ⚡</p>

<p><strong>2. Binary Representation:</strong><br>
In digital systems, we use electrical charge presence (1) or absence (0) to represent binary digits. So, a charged capacitor represents 1, while a discharged one represents 0. It's like flipping a light switch on and off! 💡</p>

<p><strong>3. Memory Cells:</strong><br>
Memory cells are like tiny containers within a computer's memory, capable of holding one piece of data. Each cell typically contains a capacitor and some control circuitry to manage charging and discharging. It's like having individual storage lockers for each piece of information! 🔒</p>

<p><strong>4. Practical Implementation:</strong><br>
Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) is a common type of computer memory that uses capacitors to store data. Each memory cell in DRAM consists of a capacitor and a transistor. The transistor acts like a switch, allowing the capacitor to be turned on or off. It's like having a light switch to control each storage locker! 💻</p>

<p><strong>5. Limitations and Challenges:</strong><br>
Capacitors have a tendency to lose their charge over time, leading to data loss if not refreshed periodically. This is why DRAM needs to refresh its memory cells regularly. Additionally, as technology advances, fitting more memory cells onto a chip becomes challenging due to the risk of charge leakage. 📉</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>
By using capacitors, computer memory efficiently stores and retrieves binary data. Understanding this process gives us insights into how digital systems work and lays the foundation for advanced computer architecture and design. 🏗️💻</p>

<p><strong>Refer to the video for a comprehensive understanding of the functionality of modern memory storage devices:</strong></p>

<p>Now that we understand how memory stores information, let's explore how data is converted from human-readable format to machine-level representation (binary). Let's take the example of the numeral 10:</p>

<p>The number 10 is represented as 1010 in binary. You can try converting it yourself using this <a href="https://madformath.com/calculators/basic-math/base-converters/decimal-to-binary-converter-with-steps/decimal-to-binary-converter-with-steps" target="_blank">online converter</a>.</p>

<p>Next, let's see how the binary number 1010 could be stored in a capacitor circuit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The rightmost bit (LSB) is 0, so the first capacitor would be discharged.</li>
  <li>The second bit is 1, so the second capacitor would be charged.</li>
  <li>The third bit is 0, so the third capacitor would be discharged.</li>
  <li>The leftmost bit (MSB) is 1, so the fourth capacitor would be charged.</li>
</ul>

<p>This arrangement represents the binary number 1010 in the capacitor circuit. Each capacitor's state (charged or discharged) corresponds to the binary value of its respective bit. 🔄</p>

<p>So that's how data is stored! In the next section, we'll explore how computers process this data.</p>

<h1 id="motivation">To Understand How Computation Happens</h1>

<p>Computers are like super-fast problem-solving machines! 🚀 They tackle complex tasks by breaking them down into simple steps and performing them at lightning speed. 🌟 Let's dive into the basics of computation to understand how these amazing machines work!</p>

<p><strong>1. Basic Operations:</strong><br>
Imagine arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, but in the language of computers – binary! 💻 Instead of using regular numbers, computers work with binary digits, or "bits," which are either 0 or 1. These operations are the building blocks of all computer tasks. Think of them as the ABCs of computation! 🧮</p>

<p><strong>2. Logic Gates:</strong><br>
Now, let's meet the superheroes of digital logic – logic gates! 🔌 These tiny electronic devices follow strict rules to manipulate binary information. They come in different types like AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND, and NOR. Each gate takes binary inputs and produces a single output based on its function. 💡 By combining these gates in various ways, computers can perform complex tasks like making decisions and solving puzzles! 🎮</p>

<p>By understanding these fundamental concepts, we unlock the secrets of computation and pave the way for exploring more advanced topics in computer science and engineering! 🛠️💡</p>

<p><strong>3. Boolean Algebra:</strong><br>
Boolean algebra provides a mathematical framework for expressing and analyzing logical relationships. It employs binary variables and operators to represent logical expressions. This algebraic system forms the basis for digital circuit design, enabling engineers to create efficient and reliable computational systems.</p>

<p><strong>4. Binary Addition and Subtraction:</strong><br>
Binary addition and subtraction are fundamental arithmetic operations in digital computation. Using algorithms tailored for binary numbers, computers perform these operations swiftly and accurately. By breaking down complex mathematical tasks into elementary binary operations, computers can solve a myriad of problems.</p>

<p><strong>5. Multiplexers and Demultiplexers:</strong><br>
Multiplexers and demultiplexers are crucial components in digital circuits, facilitating the routing of data between multiple sources and destinations. Multiplexers consolidate multiple input signals into a single output, while demultiplexers distribute a single input signal across multiple outputs. These versatile devices play a vital role in data transmission and manipulation.</p>

<p><strong>6. Registers and Counters:</strong><br>
Registers and counters are storage elements used to hold and manipulate data within a computer system. Registers store temporary data during computation, while counters track the number of occurrences of a particular event. These elements form the backbone of digital systems, enabling the execution of complex algorithms and tasks.</p>

<p><strong>7. Sequential Logic:</strong><br>
Sequential logic circuits incorporate memory elements known as flip-flops to store state information. These circuits exhibit behavior dependent on both current inputs and previous states, enabling the implementation of sequential processes. Sequential logic forms the basis for memory elements, sequential processors, and other advanced computational structures.</p>
