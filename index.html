        <bold style="font-size: 30px">In</bold> Engineering, we learn about lots of different subjects, Technologies and many more things. But one thing that often gets forgotten is knowing how to use these technologies effectively.

Our program is here to help with that. </p>
<p>
  <strong>
    The Main aim is fill the Knowledge Gap Between curriculum and actual need.</strong>
  <h2 style="border: 2px solid white; padding: 10px;">Our Equation:<br>Missing Knowledge = actual knowledge - curriculum knowing(or)learning</h2>
  

</p>
<p>We teach students how to use important tools and technologies that are useful in many different areas giving importance to small detailing. Whether you're studying computer science, engineering, data analysis, or something else, we'll show you how to use tools like the command line, text editors, and version control systems etc....
</p><p>
By learning these skills, you'll be better equipped to work efficiently no matter what you're studying. It'll help you solve tricky problems and spend less time struggling with your tools.
</p><p>
Our goal is to make sure you feel confident using these tools & technologies in whatever field you choose to explore.</p>
