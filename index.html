        <p>
Our program is here to help with that. We teach students how to use important tools and technologies that are useful in many different areas giving importance to small detailing. Whether you're studying computer science, engineering, data analysis, or something else, we'll show you how to use tools like the command line, text editors, and version control systems etc....
